# Hello-World-Game

A multiple choice game for IOS where users can learn how to write "Hello World!" in English, Spanish, and Chinese. One point is awarded for choosing the correct answer to each question. When all three questions are answered, the app will display the user's score and give them the option of restarting from the first question with 0 points.

My initial idea was to do a project which involved other languages. Originally I was going to have the text "Hello World!" change languages upon clicking a button, but then I figured that making it a simple game would be more interactive. This project was a good way to practice using xcode on a Mac and to learn some basic objective-c.
